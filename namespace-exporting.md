# Namespace Exporting

This syntax in TypeScript is called a namespace re-export with renaming.

The statement `export * as foo from './data/channels'` does the following:

1. It imports all exports (both default and named) from the module located at './data/channels'
2. It groups all these imports together as properties of a single object named 'foo'
3. It re-exports this object as a named export

This is a convenient way to import all the functionality from another module and expose it as a single namespace.

For example, if './data/channels' has exports like:

```typescript
export const channel1 = "abc";
export const channel2 = "def";
export function getChannel() {
  /* ... */
}
```

Then after the namespace re-export, other modules can import and use these as:

```typescript
import { foo } from "./path/to/your/module";

console.log(foo.channel1); // 'abc'
console.log(foo.channel2); // 'def'
foo.getChannel();
```

This syntax was introduced in TypeScript 3.8 and is equivalent to the more verbose:

```typescript
import * as tempNamespace from "./data/channels";
export const foo = tempNamespace;
```

It's particularly useful for creating organized API boundaries or when bundling related functionality under descriptive namespace names.
