# What does it mean when optional chaining implements "early termination"?

It means that when using the optional chaining operator `(?)`, if any part of a chain of property accesses evaluates to `null` or `undefined`, the evaluation stops immediately and returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

```javascript
// Without optional chaining
if (user && user.address && user.address.street) {
  console.log(user.address.street.name);
}

// With optional chaining
console.log(user?.address?.street?.name);
```

The "early termination" aspect works like this:

1. If `user` is `null` or `undefined`, the evaluation stops right there
2. The rest of the expression (`address?.street?.name`) is never evaluated
3. The entire expression returns `undefined`
4. No "cannot read property 'address' of null" error is thrown

This is particularly useful because:

1. It makes code more concise and readable
2. It eliminates the need for multiple nested condition checks
3. It prevents runtime errors when accessing properties of potentially null objects
4. It allows for safer property access in asynchronous code where values might not be available yet

The early termination behavior is what makes optional chaining so powerful for handling deeply nested properties in a safe way, especially when dealing with data that might be incomplete or when working with APIs that return complex objects.

# When an optional chain fails, does it always return `undefined`?

Yes, when an optional chain fails (meaning any part of the chain evaluates to `null` or `undefined`), it always returns `undefined`, regardless of where in the chain the failure occurs.

This is true even if the chain is evaluating something that would normally return a different value. For example:

```javascript
// These all return undefined when user is null or undefined
user?.name;
user?.getName();
user?.friends[0];
user?.["property-name"];
```

There's one important exception to note: when optional chaining is used with the nullish coalescing operator (`??`), you can provide a fallback value:

```javascript
// Returns "Guest" when user is null or undefined
const name = user?.name ?? "Guest";
```

In this case, the optional chain itself still evaluates to `undefined` when it fails, but then the nullish coalescing operator replaces that `undefined` with the fallback value.

This consistent behavior is what makes optional chaining so useful - it provides a predictable way to safely access properties without throwing errors, always defaulting to `undefined` when any part of the chain is missing.
