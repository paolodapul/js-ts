# When to opt for functional programming patterns vs. object-oriented?

When deciding between functional programming (FP) and object-oriented programming (OOP) approaches for business-oriented TypeScript projects, it's best to consider the specific needs of your project rather than strictly adhering to one paradigm.

## Consider Functional Programming when:

1. Working with data transformations and processing pipelines
2. Implementing business logic with minimal side effects
3. Building state management solutions (Redux-like patterns)
4. Creating utility functions that operate on common data structures
5. Handling asynchronous operations with predictable flows

## Consider Object-Oriented Programming when:

1. Modeling domain entities with clear behaviors and responsibilities
2. Implementing design patterns that map well to business concepts
3. Working with frameworks that emphasize class-based architectures
4. Building complex UI components with internal state
5. Creating services that encapsulate related functionality

## Hybrid Approaches Often Work Best

Most successful TypeScript business applications leverage a combination of both paradigms:

- Use classes to model your domain and organize related functionality
- Use pure functions for data transformations and business rules
- Leverage TypeScript's interface system to define contracts that work well with both approaches
- Consider immutability for state management while using classes for organization

TypeScript is particularly well-suited for this hybrid approach, as it provides excellent support for both functional and object-oriented patterns through its type system.
